  syllabics
  Canadian Aboriginal syllabics
    **Syllabics** is a writing system for nêhiyawêwin (in syllabics, ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ)
    that uses symbols to represent full syllables. Cree syllabics form a part of
    the **Canadian Aboriginal syllabics** writing system family.

  Latn
    The :term:`ISO 15924` code for the Latin writing system, including
    :term:`Standard Roman Orthography`.

  SRO
  Standard Roman Orthography
    **Standard Roman Orthography** or **SRO** is a writing system for
    nêhiyawêwin that uses the Latin alphabet (the same alphabet as English and
    French). Initial attempts to write nêhiyawêwin in the Latin alphabet
    resulted in several different spellings, and several different ways to write
    the same thing [Okimāsis]_. **SRO** is a common way to write nêhiyawêwin
    words in Latin script. Even though **SRO** attempts to be uniform, there are
    still variations, such as the use of :term:`circumflexes<circumflex>` (âêîô)
    or :term:`macrons<macron>` (āēīō).

  orthography
    **Orthography** is the set of rules for writing a certain language.
    **Orthography** is Greek for "correct writing".

    long vowels in nêhiyawêwin.

    A **circumflex** is the little hat on top of a vowel (◌̂), used to represent
    long vowels in nêhiyawêwin

  transliterator
  transcriptor

  Plains Cree
  Cree Y-dialect
  nêhiyawêwin
    **Plains Cree**, **Cree Y-Dialect**, or **nêhiyawêwin** is the most
    widely-spoken Cree dialect. Notably, many words which have a "th" in Woods
    Cree and words that have a "n" in Swampy Cree have a "y" in Plains Cree;
    this is why Plains Cree is also known as the Cree Y-dialect.

  sandhi
    Changes to pronunciation across word and *morpheme* boundaries. In Cree,
    this may when two morphemes are joined such as *pîhc-* and *-âyihk*. Written
    in SRO, it's *pîhc-âyihk*. Sandhi in Cree means that the "c" in the first
    morpheme and the "â" in the next morpheme should be pronounced together. Hence,
    it is pronounced as \* *pîh-câ-yihk*. The syllabics transliteration should be
    written as it is pronounced, thus *pîhc-âyihk* should be rendered as
    **ᐲᐦᒑᔨᕽ** and not as **ᐲᐦᐨ-ᐋᔨᕽ**.

    For a more thorough description of sandhi in Cree, see [Wolfart]_ and
    [Wolvengrey]_.

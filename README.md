Roman Orthography (SRO) and Canadian Aboriginal syllabics!

Install
-------

    pip install crk_orthography

Usage
-----

### As a Python module

Convert SRO to syllabics:

    >>> from crk_orthography import sro2syllabics
    >>> sro2syllabics('nêhiyawêwin')
    'ᓀᐦᔭᐍᐏᐣ'
    >>> sro2syllabics('write nêhiyawêwin')
    'write ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ'

Convert syllabics to SRO:

    >>> from crk_orthography import syllabics2sro
    >>> syllabics2sro('ᐊᒋᒧᓯᐢ')
    'acimosis'
    >>> syllabics2sro(' → ᒪᐢᑫᑯᓯᕽ  ᑎᕒᐁᕀᓬ ')
    ' → maskêkosihk  tireyl '


### On the command line

Once installed as a Python module, you can invoke its command line mode
by writing `python3 -m crk_orthography`. When invoked this way, it
converts each line of input from SRO to syllabics.

    $ echo "minôs" | python3 -m crk_orthography
    ᒥᓅᐢ
